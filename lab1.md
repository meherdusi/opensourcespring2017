	2. From my past experience, it is important to understand what you are asking the most, and if you dont have a question you should ask yourself if you understand everything as much as you can, because as soon as you understand one thing, two more questions appear about the same topic.
	3. It is interesting to see that a former student of the same school that we all go to was so influential in the world of copyright infringement. His story is almost a little scary and at times reading it, I couldn't help but wonder myself, what if that happened to me. Reading through the chapter, it was motivating to see the outcome, although Jesse still lost money, he became an activist and was able to have his story told, which is positive. Seeing what I have already learned so far in this class, I can use Jesses story to my advantage and known what not to do, but also what to do in the event something catastrophic happens. I particularly liked reading about the unfairness the RIAA has when it comes to earning money. I think it is important to read articles such as these because it gives us a better perspective when we are just tinkering around with software and programs. I definitely see how labeling a program as open source would have been extremely beneficial in Jesse’s case, and it’s a lesson I hope don’t have to learn the hard way. Part of me wonders what I would be able to do after taking this class with the knowledge about open source software.

	2. Reflection
	I am interested in music and making audio programs to process sound. I was thinking about taking input audio files and running them through a program that I would make, to output bassline patterns and sounds. I could write this as a VST (virtual studio technology) program for digital audio workspaces or a standalone program or both. I will continue researching how to do this by learning how vst's are written and seeing if there are similar programs already avaliable.
