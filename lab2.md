2.	Open source licenses, protect both the developer and the user. They grant permission to everyone to use, modify, and share licensed software for any purpose, subject to conditions preserving the provenance and openness of the software.
3.	Generally it means you have no permission from the creators of the software to use, modify, or share the software. You could get sued for copyright infringement.
4.	I think that it is important to release software to the public for the exact claim the article states, "they also have a strong incentive to make improvements to the tools that they themselves use regularly." I belive it is not up to a select few people to decide what the right thing is for many others to use, because usually the customer is right; it's good to get input from all around.
5.	The MIT license is widely understood to mean "you can do whatever you wish with this code."  The MIT Licence includes a clause requiring all advertising of the software to display a notice crediting its authors, which is important for certian projects if you would like recognition.
6.	Example Project: TAPESTREA, Techniques And Paradigms for Expressive Synthesis, Transformation, 
and Rendering of Environmental Audio. We would use the GPLv2 licence because we would like to have others contribute to our code and we would learn from others how to deal with our processes. It would be a fair process for both entities.
7.	I belive the MIT License is better for the common good because it is short and to the point. It lets people do anything they want with your code as long as they provide attribution back to you and donâ€™t hold you liable. For a developer, I believe that the GNU GPLv3 is the best option. Beacause is a copyleft license that requires anyone who distributes your code or a derivative work to make the source available under the same terms, you can keep your projects safe and secure with collaborators. Finally I think the best licence for a company is the Apache License 2.0. Its a permissive license similar to the MIT License, but also provides an express grant of patent rights from contributors to users, which is the best option for a company.

9.	For a project in this course, I am interested in making a audio DSP device that takes in prerecorded signals and granulizes them and convertets them into audio patterns to use in songs. Artists and programmers interested in hearing what different recordings sound like when run through algorithms. It can be used in data ambisonics for sonification and would be applicable in large speaker arrays. Artists intersted in using this would be able to create leads and melodys for songs along with drum samples. It would be interesting to see what creativity could come out of this program by hosting it open source.
